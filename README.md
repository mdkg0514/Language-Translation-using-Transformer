# Language-Translation-using-Transformer

## Overview
This project implements **English-to-French Machine Translation** using a **Transformer model**. The model is trained on parallel text datasets to learn accurate translations.

## Features
- Uses **Transformer-based architecture** for translation
- Trained on an **English-French parallel dataset**
- Implements **tokenization and attention mechanisms**
- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** or **Hugging Face Transformers**

## Installation
```bash
pip install transformers torch sentencepiece datasets
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Language_Translation.ipynb
```

## Files
- `Language_Translation.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook implementing the translation model.

## Future Enhancements
- Fine-tune the model on a larger dataset
- Extend to multi-language translation
- Deploy as a web API for real-time translation
